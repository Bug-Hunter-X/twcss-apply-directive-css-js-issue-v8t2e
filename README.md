# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue with CSS-in-JS

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive fails to work correctly within a CSS-in-JS environment (specifically styled-components). The issue is that utility classes are not applied, and the expected styling changes are not reflected.  The solution shows how to resolve this issue by properly configuring and including Tailwind directives within your styled components.
